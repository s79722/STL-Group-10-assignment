 Introduction 
The Online Food Order System is a computer-based application that enables 
customers to view menus from food vendors, order food, as well as pay for the food online. 
Essentially, the Online Food Order System is a centralized software that brings together 
customers, food vendors, and food order services. The primary aim of developing Online 
Food Ordering System is to ease the existing food ordering process without using telephone 
calls or actually visiting eating joints. Customers can register, login, order food, monitor 
their orders and get food delivered to their desired destination. Food joints will benefit from 
this by efficiently managing orders, minimizing mistakes and increasing their customer 
base. Such a system is widely applied in the current digital technology era because it saves 
time, increases the degree of accuracy and increases customer satisfaction. This project 
makes use of system thinking and logical design in order to concentrate on the breakdown 
of the Online Food Ordering System.
